# Practical Application III: Comparing Classifiers

**Overview**: In this practical application, our goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.  We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.  

### Problem 1: Understanding the Data

To gain a better understanding of the data, I looked at information provided in the CRISP-DM-BANK.PDF, and examine the **Materials and Methods** section of the paper. 

 1, How many marketing campaigns does this data represent?

 The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts. During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered. For each contact, a large number of attributes was stored and if there was a success (the target variable). There were 6499 successes (8% success rate).
